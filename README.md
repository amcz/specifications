# CF-Compliant NetCDF Specification Guide

This document outlines the standards and conventions for creating [Climate and Forecast (CF)](http://cfconventions.org/) compliant NetCDF files for atmospheric and environmental data. The CF conventions aim to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast data using self-describing, portable NetCDF files.

## ðŸ“¦ File Structure

A CF-compliant NetCDF file typically includes:

- **Dimensions** â€“ named axes of the data (e.g., time, latitude, longitude, level).
- **Variables** â€“ data arrays, each associated with a subset of the dimensions.
- **Attributes** â€“ metadata for the file or individual variables (units, standard names, etc.).
