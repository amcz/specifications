# CF-Compliant NetCDF Specification Guide

This document outlines the standards and conventions for creating [Climate and Forecast (CF)](http://cfconventions.org/) compliant NetCDF files for volcanic ash forecasts. The CF conventions aim to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast data using self-describing, portable NetCDF files. Two file types are described. One contains information on ash concentrations while the other contains information on probabilities of exceedances of ash concentrations.

reason_definitions  : EXERCISE: produced for an exercise, TEST: produced for a test, HYPOTHETICAL: produced for possible future event

```

* volcano names and volcano id (vid) should be taken from the Smithsonian list https://volcano.si.edu/projects/vaac-data/.
* if volcano is unknown then 'unknown' should be used
* status, usage, and reason are utilized in IWXXM file
* history is needed for CF compliance. Unclear what information it should contain.

## ðŸ§­Coordinate Variables
and their associated dimensions

###  Concentration File
```text
latitude (longitude)
ATTRIBUTES
   standard_name : latitude
   units :  degrees_north
   bounds : latitude_bounds
   long_name : latitude degrees north from the equator
   axis : Y 

longitude (longitude)
ATTRIBUTES
   standard_name : longitude
   units :  degrees_north
   bounds : latitude_bounds
   long_name :  latitude degrees east from the greenwich meridian
   axis : X

z(z)
ATTRIBUTES
  units : feet
  standard_name : height_above_mean_sea_level
  positive : up
  bounds : z_bounds
  long_name : altitude at center of vertical level
  axis : Z

time(time)
ATTRIBUTES
  units : hours since YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ
  long_name: time at beginning of sampling period
  standard_name : time
  calendar : standard OR gregorian
  bounds : time_bounds
  axis : T

bnds (bnds)
Type: int32
Values: 0,1

```

## Horizontal grid resolution and specification

* The standard resolution of the spatial grid is 0.25 degrees
* Higher resolutions may be allowed
* Currently some VAACs center their grids on X.0 while others center their grids on X.125.
While it is preferential that VAACs define their grids so they can be easily overlapped, it is not possible
currently for all VAACs to change their operational setup to allow this. However it seems that VAACs who have more
frequent hand-offs do have similar setups. 

## Probabilistic File

Same coordinates as concentration file but with one additional coordinate.

  ```text
  threshold
  Values: [0.2, 2, 5, 10]
  ATTRIBUTES
    units : mg m-3
    standard_name: volcanic_ash_air_concentration
    long_name: Threshold for exceedance probability
  ```

  *  see alternative methods of specifying vertical coordinate
  * different ways of specifying reference time for time coordinate may be used


## ðŸ“ŠMain Data Variable

### Concentration File

```text
ash_concentration (time, latitude, longitude, z)
ATTRIBUTES
   standard_name : mass_concentration_of_volcanic_ash_in_air
   long_name : volcanic ash mass concentration in air as determined from model
   units : mg m-3
   cell_methods : time: mean withinbounds, longitude: mean within bounds, latitude: mean within bounds, z: mean within bounds
```

* use appropriate description in cell methods
* mg/m^3 is also CF compliant unit specification

### Probabilistic File
```text
ash_probability (time, latitude, longitude, z, threshold)
ATTRIBUTES
   standard_name : probability_of_exceedance_of_volcanic_ash_air_concentration
   long_name : probability that volcanic ash concentration exceeds threshold as determined from model
   units : percent
```
* no appropriate standard_name exists with CF name tables for ash probability of exceedance.

## Flight Levels

Data variable which provides vertical levels in FL 

```text
flight_levels (z)
values [25, 75, 125, 175, 225, 275, 325, 375, 425, 475, 525, 575]
ATTRIBUTES
   standard_name : flight_level
   long_name : flight levels at center of vertical level
   bounds : flight_level_bounds
   units : 100 feet
   comment : flight level is defined as altitude in hundreds of feet
```
 * hft or hecta-feet is not considered compliant as it combines SI prefix with English unit
 * no standard_name in CF tables
 * this data variable may be ommitted if flight_levels is utilized as a dimension/coordinate in the alternative formulation.

## Bounds Variables 

These define spatial and temporal bounds for CF compliance.

```text
time_bounds (time bnds)

latitude_bounds (latitude, bnds)

longitude_bounds (longitude, bnds)

z_bounds (z, bnds)

flight_level_bounds (z, bnds)
```
* If not using temporal averaging then time_bounds does not need to be defined.
* z_bounds not needed if using alternative method of specifying vertical coordinate.

## Defining Mapping 

### `crs ()`

- Include grid mapping metadata for spatial projection:
- Below is example for spherical earth
  ```text
  ATTRIBUTES
      crs:grid_mapping_name = latitude_longitude
      earth_radius : 6378200.0
      long_name : Spherical earth with radius 6371.2 km
      comment : This grid uses spherical Earth approximation. No EPSG code applies.
  ```

---
## Alternative formulations

### Alternative specification for vertical coordinate

Some centers may use flight_level as the vertical coordinate and dimension in place of z. This may not work as well with some GIS software which may not recognize 100 ft as a CF compliant unit.

### Alternative method for latitude and longitude dimension

It is also CF compliant to define dimensions x, y instead of latitude, longitude.
Then the latitude and longitude coordinates have dimensions  latitude(y) and longitude(x).
